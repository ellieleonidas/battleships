# battleships
I created this battleship game using node.js and socket.io. Because my knowledge of socket.io and javascript is limited, I followed a video tutorial by the amazing codeSTACKr. He walked me through how to code the game. I then modified the css and html to make it my own. 

There are two ways to play battleship. You can choose to play singleplayer, where you play against the computer. Otherwise, you can chose multiplayer where you can play against a friend on the same server. The game will recognize when each player has joined the server. It will only allow for two people to play at once, otherwise it will inform you that the server is full.

Here is the link to the javascript breakdown so someone else can create this in the future: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpAwggQJPUQ
